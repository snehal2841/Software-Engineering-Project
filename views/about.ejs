        <p>This is a really cool feature, What you need to do is just open recording mode in your old phone then enter any random number(preferably long for privacy) and then click on record and then place the phone at a desired place of your house. Now, open your existing phone or any other device and go under the recording mode into it and place the same number as entered before and finally click on "Track". And, you will be able to see the view captured by your old phone from your existing deviceðŸ˜‰.</p>
